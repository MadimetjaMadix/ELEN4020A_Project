## ELEN4020A Project 2019

##### Introduction
In this project, MPI-IO and Out of Core Matrix Transposition of Big Data is performed.

##### Problem
The problem definition is simply to develop and implement a parallel matrix transposition 
algorithm for very large datasets that will be held out-of-core, in a file.
